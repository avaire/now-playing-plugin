AvaIre Now Playing
==================

AvaIre Now Playing is a simple plugin that links the bots status to the music handler, whenever a song is played in a verified server the status message in the bot will update to reflect what is being played.

## How to Use

> **Note:** This assumes you're already self-hosting Ava, this plugin won't do anything on its own!

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/avaire/now-playing-plugin/releases) off github and place the `.jar` file within the plugins folder.
2. Start up Ava to make Ava recognize the plugin.
3. Edit the plugins config file to add your verified servers, the config file can be found at `plugins/NowPlaying/config.yml`
4. Reboot the bot, or reload the configs using the `;reload` system command

And you're done!
